An optimal way to prepare for coding interviews:

1. Foundation Phase:
Resources for Learning:
- Courses: [MIT OpenCourseWare Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/)
- YouTube: [Abdul Bari (Algorithms)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O&si=BV3foprLkBfq4A6d), [William Fiset (Data Structures)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsB6SWUrDFW2RmDotAfPbeHu&si=ORhankjCAWGvelP9)
- Websites: [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- Books: "Cracking the Coding Interview", "Grokking Algorithms"

2. Learning Phase:
What to Do:
- Set 10-minute limit for solving. If stuck → check solution
- Understanding concept means: Identify core technique and apply it to similar problems
  Example: If problem needs "find in sorted sequence" → think binary search for all similar cases
- Start with categorized problems (Arrays, Trees, etc.) to build base knowledge
- Goal: Learn to recognize common patterns like:
  * "Find in sorted" → Binary Search
  * "Subarray sum" → Sliding Window
  * "All combinations" → Backtracking
- Target: Solve ~100 problems across main patterns

3. Interview Training Phase:
- Practice one-shot solutions: Debug in head, not by running code
- Time limits: 20 min (medium), 30-40 min (hard)
- Always push for optimal solution (time/space complexity)
- Solve random problems without knowing category
  (Real interviews don't tell you "this is a dynamic programming problem")

4. Mock Interview Phase:
Platforms for Practice:
- Pramp/Exponent
- CodeSignal Interview Practice
- LeetCode Premium Mock Interviews
- Tech Mock Interview (paid service)

Mock Interview Communities:
- Reddit: r/codinginterviews, r/leetcodegrind
- Discord: 
  * Tech Interview Pro (from Patrick Shyu)
  * Leetcode Discord (official)
  * Blind Discord

Technical Explanation Framework:
1. STAR Method for Technical Solutions:
   - Situation: Problem constraints and inputs
   - Task: What needs to be achieved
   - Approach: Why chosen this solution
   - Result: Time/space complexity and trade-offs

2. "Think Aloud Protocol" (Google Method):
   - State approach before coding
   - Explain decisions while coding
   - Discuss trade-offs after completion

Key Practice Areas:
- Handling Interruptions: Practice explaining while coding
  Example: Friend asks questions while you solve problems
  Technique: Learn to say "Let me finish this thought, then I'll address your question"

- Context Switching Example:
  During problem solving:
  1. Writing array logic
  2. Interviewer suggests different approach
  3. Need to mentally switch gears while keeping original solution in mind
  Practice: Have friend interrupt with suggestions during practice sessions

- Back-to-back Interview Practice:
  Do 2-3 LeetCode hard problems in row with 5-min breaks
  Helps build mental stamina for multiple interview rounds

5. Interview Readiness:
- Practice Goal: Pass 8/10 mock interviews on platforms mentioned above
- "Strong hire" means:
  * Optimal solution
  * Clear explanation
  * Good code quality
  * Handled edge cases
  * Completed within time limit

To Stand Out:
- Prepare your own test cases before coding
- Explain trade-offs between different solutions
- Have working examples ready
- Show system design consideration even in coding questions
- Write clean, well-structured code with good variable names
- Ask clarifying questions early
